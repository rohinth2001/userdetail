I have used "REACT JS" and "FIREBASE"  to develope a project

In this project user want to create an account by clicking "create your project account" or by clicking "google icon"
and then login in to your account.

Firebase is used for autentication


you can select the user name first and it will return the details of the selected user and you can use next and prev for navigation amoung users
